        In Smash Ultimate a mechanic was introduced to launches that cause tumble to make it faster, this is called DamageFlySpeedUp on game symbols and is is often refered as <b>balloon knockback</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Obtaining launch speed from knockback and the decay it's applied works exactly the same as previous Smash games, however the game makes additional calculations for launch speed and character position on the first frames of the launch instead of one reducing in-game hitstun but keeping the same launch distance
